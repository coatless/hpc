# Cluster Computing



## What is Cluster Computing?

Definition: Cluster

A **cluster** is a _set of computers_ that are connected together and share 
resources as if they were one gigantic computer.

## How Does Cluster Computing WorK?

Definition: Parallel Processing

**Parallel Processing** is the act of carrying out multiple tasks simultaneously to solve a problem. 
This is accomplished by dividing the problem into independent subparts,
which are then solved concurrently.


Definition: Jobs

**Jobs** denote the independent subparts.


## Why use Cluster Computing?

Pros

- Speeds up simulations by allowing iterations to be run simultaneously.
- Provides more resources for computations.
    - e.g. CPU Cores, RAM, Hard Drive Space, and Graphics Cards (GPUs).
- Nightly snapshots/backups of files.
- Extends the lifespan of your computer.

Cons

- Simulations are **not** instantly run.
    - Need to "queue" for resources.
- Higher barrier of entry due to knowledge requirements.
- Poorly handles opening and closing data sets.
- Adding or updating software is complex.
