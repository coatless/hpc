# Welcome to HPC

The goal of High Performance Computing on a Cluster with _R_ is to inform and
distribute various recipes and techniques for performing computational-intensive
work on remote computing resources.

### Thanks!

This work made use of the Illinois Campus Cluster, a computing resource that is operated by the [Illinois Campus Cluster Program (ICCP)](https://campuscluster.illinois.edu/) in conjunction with the [National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA)](https://ncsa.illinois.edu) and which is supported by funds from the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu).
